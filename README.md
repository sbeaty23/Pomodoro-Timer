# Pomodoro-Timer

##Description
I built this project because of the many people I have seen studying for long periods of time with no breaks. When this project is complete, it will serve as a study resource for friends, colleagues, and students I tutor and work with. This project serves as a way for me to learn how to apply front end development libraries like Reaxct.js, Redux.js, SASS, and others outside of the learning platforms I used them on.
